1. Our abstract Syntax tree, as a data structure, will have a Program Node as its root node. This node will store an arraylist of Nodes, specifically of type RuleNode. RuleNode is another instance of Node that represents the relationship between a condition and a command. Thus, Rule will have, as fields, a ConditionNode and a CommandNode. The condition Node represents a condition and thus must evaluate to True or False. Since ConditionNode itself is an interface, when I say ConditionNode, I really mean the classes that implement it, which are BinaryCondition and Relation. A BinaryCondition holds two instances of condition as fields and links them with an operator of && or ||. If multiple BinaryConditions are needed (...||...&&...), this is accounted for by the fact that a binaryop is a condition, so BinaryCondition can store a BinaryCondition as one of its fields. A Relation holds two expressions and links them with a relational operator (<, >, ==, etc.). The expression class will be discussed in detail later. The condition, if True, will permit Rule to evaluate and perform the commandNode. The commandNode holds a list of updates and an action, initially set to null. Update itself is a Node and thus implements the Node interface. It symbolizes the relationship "mem[expr] := expr", and thus holds two nodes: a MemoryNode and an Expression Node. The ActionNode of a commandNode is a Node that symbolizes one unique action (wait, forward, backward, etc.) and holds a String representing which Action it is, as well as a possible expression, originally set to null, since some actions may contain expressions. An expression is a sub-interface of Node which contains two classes: NumberNode and BinaryOperation. A NumberNode is intuitively a Node representing one number. A BinaryOperation is a node which contains two expressions and one operation (+,-,/,*) which it applies to them. Therefore, an expression will ALWAYS evaluate to a number, if the inputs are correct. This is the structure of the abstract syntax tree.
