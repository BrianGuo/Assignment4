Overview:

What we need to do:
  Display the state of the world: Essentially visually display hexagons, rocks, critters, food.
  
  Also # of critters and timesteps advanced
  
    - Current equivalent is the info function which means all this information is stored in simulator.
    
    - Just need graphical representation, do not use "-" but hexagons.
    
  Step 1 time per click, or step infinitely many times until all critters die:
  
    - Simulator equivalent is the step function.
    
    - Allow user to select the number of frames/second
    
  Display total Steps and critters alive
  
  Worlds
  
    -Create a new random world (newWorld() function in simulator)
    
    -Load a world: Display user hardDrive and allow user to select a file
  
  Critters
  
    -Load a critter
    
    -Place a critter onto the world
    
      -Toggle placeMode and click multiple times
      
      -Select a number to place randomly. Write as numberfield.
  
  Click a hex and view info in info panel.
